# Sales_Dashboard
Automated Power BI dashboard for AtliQ Hardware, offering real-time sales insights to support data-driven decisions. Includes MySQL integration, DAX queries, and visualizations of sales trends, top customers, products, and market performance. Identifies focus areas to boost recovery.

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware is a company that supplies computer hardware and peripherals to many clients across India. The Sales Director of the company is currently facing challenges due to the dynamically growing market. He struggles to track sales performance accurately and obtain actionable insights.

The primary issue is that the Sales Director relies on verbal communication with regional managers to gather updates. These conversations often lack clarity, as managers tend to paint overly optimistic pictures of the sales situation. Some managers may unintentionally sugarcoat facts, while others might misreport data.

When asked for numerical data, the regional managers share multiple Excel files, which are tedious and time-consuming for the Sales Director to analyze. Frustrated by declining sales and the lack of reliable insights, the Sales Director is looking for a solution that provides a simple, clear, and actionable view of the companyâ€™s sales performance. He envisions a dashboard that presents real-time data and enables data-driven decision-making to grow the business.
